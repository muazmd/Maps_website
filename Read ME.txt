This Webpage is about a gaming store called Maps which sells Games,
The main page is called index.php which is the sign up
There are 2 roles for this website: A user which sign up normally and Admin which has a user "maps" and password"maps",
and if you logged as an admin you can add games to a specific page
You can add the games you want to buy from any page and press the checkout button.
